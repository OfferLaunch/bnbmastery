Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our Site. We may also gather certain information automatically, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), operating system, your Site activity (including the Site content you view, mouse movements, mouse clicks, taps, swipes, and information you view), and/or clickstream data for purposes such as analyzing trends, administering the Site, improving the function and content of the Site, and enforcing our Terms of Use. We use standard Internet technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, session replay/screen capture, and similar technologies to collect this information, as explained below in the section on cookies.</p>

                    <p>We may also collect precise information about your location, such as your mobile device's GPS coordinates, cell tower information, and/or Wi-Fi signals. We may use this information to personalize your experience in connection with your use of the Site. If you do not want bnb to collect and use your specific geolocation information, you can disable the location features on your device. Check your device manufacturer settings for how to do so.</p>

                    <p>We work with various third-party partners who help us provide and improve our services. We don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we have no plans to do so. We also impose restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide. We have summarized how we share the information we collect below.</p>

                    <p>If you have purchased a business opportunity from bnb, we may share your personal contact information with prospective customers, which is limited to your first name, first letter of your last name, phone number, and your state of residence. A prospective customer may contact you to compare your experience with what bnb told you about its business opportunity.</p>

                    <p>We may share your information with our affiliates (companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with bnb) as well as select partners. Examples of how these entities may use your information include making predictions about your interests and providing you with special offers, promotions, advertisements, and other materials.</p>

                    <p>We may share your information with vendors that perform functions on our behalf. Examples of such functions include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, email administrative functions, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.</p>

                    <p>We may also disclose your information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, legal proceedings, or similar legal process, including disclosure to authorized third-party auditors; or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate or prevent fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>

                    <p>We use remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our Site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our Site, for example using the contact form to make an inquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on a site in the Google Display Network or the Google search results page. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Any data collected will be used in accordance with Google's privacy policy and our own.</p>

                    <p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page, and you can opt-out of interest-based advertising entirely by adjusting your cookie settings or using a browser plugin.</p>
